  <a>Introduction</a>
  <p>
  In this blog post I will go over my experience as an co-op at Arctic Wolf!

  <a>Information about the Employer</a>
  <p>
For my final co-op work term, I joined Arctic Wolf. Arctic Wolf (AW) is a cybersecurity company founded 10 years ago by Brian NeSmith. AW provides security monitoring for on premises infrastructure and concierge security for its customers.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
  Most of the work I conducted at Arctic Wolf involved a part of the Golang codebase for scanner and scanner infrastructure. Scanners are instances of software that scan for security vulnerabilities. For instance, it could report if there are parts of a customer's system susceptible to Log4J exploits.

  <br>

  <Goals>
  <p>
  1) At Arctic Wolf Networks it will be my mission to make significant contributions to the codebase for the Scanner team and related software when necessary. 2) I will strive to step out of my comfort zone and ask questions whenever I am stuck. 3) I will attend company events and try to come into the office in person on a weekly basis.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
  For the most part I feel I accomplished these goals. I ended up making a lot of code contributions, I tried to ask questions when I was stuck or confused, and I tried to attend as many company events as I could.

  <a>Job Description</a>
  <p>
As mentioned earlier, I worked on software relating to scanner and scanner infrastructure. I worked with the following technologies during my time at Arctic Wolf: Python, Go, Linux, AWS, Docker, Kuberenetes, PostgreSQL, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Prometheus. Before coming to Arctic Wolf, I was only familiar with Python and Linux so I had to learn the rest of the technical skills to use these tools on the job when completing tasks. 
Most of the work I conducted at Arctic Wolf centred around a project automating the process of deactivating, or in other words churning, scanners. Scanners will need to be churned for a number of reasons; for instance, if a customer stops doing business with Arctic Wolf the scanner(s) associated with the customer should be deleted from the system. Originally, this was a long manual task. This project aimed to automate the process. As part of that project, I added a component to our Kafka messaging service to send churn notifications upon scanner deactivation. Since each scanner was associated with a rabbitmq messaging admin user which also has to be deleted upon a churn. I wrote code that sends a http request to the rabbitmq admin service to delete a user associated with that scanner. Although this project automates the churning of scanners, it can still be useful to manually churn a list of scanners. I wrote a Python script that utilizes the changes in the backend for automatic churning to allow a user to delete a list of specified scanner(s). I demonstrated how to use the churn script to another employee at Arctic Wolf.
Beyond the scanner churn project I worked on a few other projects as well. In order to help accounting keep track of the number of scanners deployed in certain regions. I developed a script that queries a database for scanners in regions and outputs the total number present in each region. I also developed an API spec for a new change to allow for more fields to be passed along with scanner scan schedules. I added a check using Prometheus to send an alert when a specific service fails.
On the side, I was also able to participate in a few fun projects, such as helping plan the co-op midterm event and participate in an Arctic Wolf musical hackathon where songs about Arctic Wolf are submitted and compiled into an album.

  <a>Conclusions</a>
  <p>
Here is a summary of the work I conducted at Arctic Wolf
---- In order to automate the deactivation of vulnerability scanners, I wrote Go code that appropriately removes data by sending Kafka and RabbitMQ messages.
---- I wrote a Python script to automate the process of deactivating lists of scanners, speeding up the originally manual process substantially.
---- I added a check using Prometheus to send an alert when a specific service fails.
---- I developed an API spec for a new change to allow for more fields to be passed along with scanner scan schedules. 
---- In order to help accounting keep track of the number of scanners deployed in certain regions, I developed a Python program that queries a database for scanners in regions and outputs the total number present in each region.

  <p>
It was a pleasure to work with everyone on my team! I'll specifically highlight a few people who I was fortunate to work with a lot during this co-op term.
---- My fellow co-op Min Park.
---- Shawana Khokher, an engineer who helped me understand the system I worked on better.
---- Mae Kennedy, who often reviewed my PRs and provided great feedback and cool tips.
---- Dhanvanthari Manjunath Ilangovan, my manager who checked up on me and made sure I was enjoying what I was working on.
