  <a>Introduction</a>
  <p>For my second coop I worked at the Kings Distributed Systems as Software Engineer in Kingston Ontario</p>
  <p>Notice: since I was working on protected parts of a closed source system, I have to generalize this coop report and discuss details at a high level. This means many details will have to be witheld from this report.</p>

  <a>Coop Goals</a>

  <p>* Goal 1    Here is a list of my coop goals for this term:</p>
  <p><b> Contribute new features to the codebase. </b></p>
  <p> * Action Plan 1 		Take action to work on new features and reach out to managers asking for opportunities to work on new features.
</p>
  <p>* Measure of Success 1 		If, by the end of the summer, I have successfully merged more than one new feature into the codebase.</p>

  </p>
  <p> <b>* Goal 2 		Become more familiar with a commandline editor. This will help me become a more efficient engineer in certain circumstances.
</b></p>
  <p>* Action Plan 2 		Exclusively use a command line editor such as vim and search on google if I get stuck on anything. </p>
<p>* Measure of Success 2 		If, by the end of the summer, I feel I am more comfortable with a commandline editor than a gui based editor.<p/>


  <p>  <b>* Goal 3 		Learn more about core CS theory. </b> </p>
    <p>* Action Plan 3 		Start an after work book club reading classic computer science literature. </p></p>
    <p>
* Measure of Success 3 		If, by the end of the summer, I have read at least 2 books on cs theory and have grown in cs areas kingsds specializes in such as distributed computing, AI, and metaprogramming.

<p> I accomplished all the goals I set forward to accomplish with respect to my coop goals I set ðŸ˜Š</p>
