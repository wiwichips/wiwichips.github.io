  <a>Introduction</a>
  <p>For my first coop I worked at the Ontario Ministry of Finance as a Data Analyst in Queen's park.</p>
  <p>Except it was remote.</p>
  <p>Although originally I was scheduled to work 8 months at the MOF, I only ended up working for 6.5 months starting June due to Covid-19.</p>
  <p>Notice: since I was working in a very secure part of government, I have to generalize this coop report and discuss details at a high level. This means many details will have to be witheld from this report.</p>

  <a>Coop Goals</a>
  <p>Here is a list of my coop goals for this term:</p>
  <p><b>Strengthen my Python programming skills.</b></p>
  <p>- Before starting this coop, I hadent worked much with Python and I wanted that to change</p>
  <p>- I wanted to learn a few different Python libraries and frameworks for handeling data and automating tasks. These include: Jypter Notebooks, Numpy, and Pandas</p>
  <p>- I accomplished this goal through crafting the automation tool that I worked with a fellow coop student on

  </p>
  <p> <b>Work on more tech related deliverables</b></p>
  <p>- During the beginning of my coop I wasn't working on many technical projects, and I really wanted to so I set a goal to beg and plead to my managers to give me more technical jobs</p>
<p> - I accomplished this by finding a few technical projects such as the automation tool <p/>
  <p>  <b>Refine my SQL and database skills</b> </p>
    <p>- Although I read a lot of SQL and relational database schema from previous coop students, I didn't have an ability to refine my SQL skills ):</p></p>
    <p> <b>Improve Data Science / Analysis Skills</b> </p>
    <p>- My action plan was to  Work with data performing operations such as Data munging, and using technologies like Python (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter), SQL, and R to answer questions about the data. </p>
    <p> <b>Improve my Economic Analysis Skills</b> </p>
    <p>- My goal was to learn about Economics models and curves that are used for work and increase my Economic Literacy.</p>
    <p> <b>Develop a Comprehensive understanding of the fundamental data (PIT)</b> </p>
    <p>- My action plan was to work on the Tax Calculator as well as review tax forms and tax returns for 2019 and 2020. Work with PIT tax data.</p>
    <p>- I did this when I made the tax calculator in excel</p>

    <p>- This coop was during the coronavirus</p>
    <p>- It was delayed by a couple months and started in mid June as a result</p>
    <p>- This also meant I was not able to work in the office and had to work remotely</p>
    <p>- I worked from homeüè°</p>
    <p>- I was not able to get VPN access to do work with a database before my coop term ended</p>
